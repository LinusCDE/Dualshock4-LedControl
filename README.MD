# Dualshock4-LedControl

This is an little application written in Java to change the color of the LED/Lightbar of the Dualshock4-Controller.
It is written to work with the SysFS in /sys. Linux does have support since Kernel 3.15.
I tested it on Kernel 4.1+ but it should work with 3.15 as well (I did not test it) and maybe other Unix-Systems like BSD or OS X.

By the way this is my first public Git-Repo and use of Maven, so excuse fails. I appreciate any help.
